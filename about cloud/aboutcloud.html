             <h2 class="mainheading">Software as a Service (SaaS) - Salesforce</h2>
             <p><strong>What is SaaS?</strong></p>
             <p>Software as a service (or SaaS; pronounced /sæs/) is a way of delivering centrally hosted applications over the Internet—as a service.<br>
                SaaS applications are sometimes called web-based software, on-demand software, or hosted software.<br>
                Whatever the name, SaaS applications run on a SaaS provider’s servers.

                Instead of installing and maintaining software, you simply access it via the Internet, freeing yourself from complex software and hardware management.<br>
                The provider manages access to the application, including security, availability, and performance. SaaS business applications are usually accessed by users using a thin client via a web browser.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Advanages of SaaS:</strong></p>
            <p>-High Adoption<br>-Lower additional costs <br>-Painless upgrades<br>-Seamless Integration</p>
            <p>SaaS facilitates remote application hosting and delivery, making this the key advantage of SaaS: painless application access. <br>
            SaaS customers have no hardware or software to buy, install, maintain, or update. Access to applications is easy—you just need an Internet connection.</p>

            <h2 class="mainheading">Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h2>
             <p><strong>What is PaaS?</strong></p>
             <p>Platform as a Service (PaaS) or application platform as a Service (aPaaS) or platform base service is a category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing customers to develop,<br>
             run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app.PaaS can be delivered in three ways: as a public cloud service from a provider,<br>
             where the consumer controls software deployment with minimal configuration options, and the provider provides the networks, servers, storage, operating system (OS), middleware (e.g. Java runtime, .NET runtime, integration, etc.),<br>
             database and other services to host the consumer's application; as a private service (software or appliance) inside the firewall; or as software deployed on a public infrastructure as a service.</p>

            <h2 class="mainheading"><h2 class="mainheading">Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - Amazon</h2>
             <p><strong>What is IaaS?</strong></p>
             <p>nfrastructure as a service (IaaS) refers to online services that provide high-level APIs used to dereference various low-level details of underlying network infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup etc.<br>
             A hypervisor, such as Xen, Oracle VirtualBox, Oracle VM, KVM, VMware ESX/ESXi, or Hyper-V, LXD, runs the virtual machines as guests.<br>
             Pools of hypervisors within the cloud operational system can support large numbers of virtual machines and the ability to scale services up and down according to customers' varying requirements. </p>
            
            <p><strong>Amazon</strong></p>
            <p>Amazon.com is a vast Internet-based enterprise that sells books, music, movies, housewares, electronics, toys, and many other goods, either directly or as the middleman between other retailers and Amazon.com’s millions of customers.br>
            Its Web services business includes renting data storage and computing resources, so-called “cloud computing,” over the Internet. Its considerable online presence is such that, in 2012, 1 percent of all Internet traffic in North America traveled in and out of Amazon.com data centres.</p>

            <h2 class="mainheading"><h2 class="mainheading">Communication as a Service (CaaS) - Gmail</h2>
             <p><strong>What is CaaS?</strong></p>
             <p>Communications as a Service (CaaS) is an outsourced enterprise communications solution that can be leased from a single vendor. Such communications can include voice over IP (VoIP or Internet telephony), instant messaging (IM), collaboration and videoconference applications using fixed and mobile devices.<br>
             The network capacity and feature set can be changed from day to day if necessary so that functionality keeps pace with demand and resources are not wasted. There is no risk of the system becoming obsolete and requiring periodic major upgrades or replacement.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Gmail</strong></p>
            <p>Gmail is a free, advertising-supported email service developed by Google. Users can access Gmail on the web and using third-party programs that synchronize email content through POP or IMAP protocols. Gmail started as a limited beta release on April 1, 2004, and ended its testing phase on July 7, 2009.
               At launch, Gmail had an initial storage capacity offer of one gigabyte per user, a significantly higher amount than competitors offered at the time. Today, the service comes with 15 gigabytes of storage. Users can receive emails up to 50 megabytes in size, including attachments, while they can send emails up to 25 megabytes.<br>
               In order to send larger files, users can insert files from Google Drive into the message. Gmail has a search-oriented interface and a "conversation view" similar to an Internet forum. The service is notable among website developers for its early adoption of Ajax.</p>
